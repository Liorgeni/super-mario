<h1>Super Mario</h1> 

This is my version of the classic Super Mario game, developed using JavaScript and Canvas. My objective was to create an entertaining and engaging experience that leverages the capabilities of the modern web while being inspired by the original Super Mario game.
I used the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) to manipulate the game objects and adjust them to my needs.

*The game design is not mine. I used sprite sheets from the internet. <br>
*The game is still under development.

## How to Play

<li>Use the W,S,A,D keys, to move Mario. Use the SPACE key, to shoot enemies (Only available after collecting Flower).</li>
<li>Avoid enemies, or kill them by landing on top of them.</li>
<li>Collect Flower, to activate your Mario's superpower. Mario is now able to shoot enemies.</li>
<li>If Mario falls down into a pit, he will die and the game will start over.</li>
<li>If an enemy hits Mario, he will die and the game will start over, unless his superpower is activated. In this case - Mario will lose his superpower, and you will be able to continue playing.</li>
<li>Keep moving forward. When you reach the flagpole, the level is over.</li>
